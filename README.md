# swapi-search
This is a fun project that makes use of the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev) to search for Star Wars characters. 

It's written Java using [Apache Wicket](https://wicket.apache.org) v9.5. You can download and run it in Eclipse. The default application URL is http://localhost:8080.

## Todos
* Create pages for each specific type of resource (films, starships, vehicles, etc.)
* Create links that would enable browsing from resource to resource. I.e. be able to go to the film pages from the Luke Skywalker people page
* Create and include a breadcrumb component at the top of each page to track browsing history
